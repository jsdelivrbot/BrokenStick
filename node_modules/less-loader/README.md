<h1 align="center">less-loader</h1>

<p align="center">Compiles Less to CSS.</p>

Use the [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) or the [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader) to turn it into a JS module and the [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) to extract it into a separate file.


<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

```bash
npm install --save-dev less-loader less
```

The less-loader requires [less](https://github.com/less/less.js) as [`peerDependency`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies). Thus you are able to control the versions accurately.

<h2 align="center">Examples</h2>

Chain the less-loader with the [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and the [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to immediately apply all styles to the DOM.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.less$/,
            use: [{
                loader: "style-loader" // creates style nodes from JS strings
            }, {
                loader: "css-loader" // translates CSS into CommonJS
            }, {
                loader: "less-loader" // compiles Less to CSS
            }]
        }]
    }
};
```

You can pass any Less specific options to the less-loader via [loader options](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-options-rule-query). See the [Less documentation](http://lesscss.org/usage/#command-line-usage-options) for all available options in dash-case. Since we're passing these options to Less programmatically, you need to pass them in camelCase here:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.less$/,
            use: [{
                loader: "style-loader"
            }, {
                loader: "css-loader"
            }, {
                loader: "less-loader", options: {
                    strictMath: true,
                    noIeCompat: true
                }
            }]
        }]
    }
};
```

Unfortunately, Less doesn't map all options 1-by-1 to camelCase. When in doubt, [check their executable and search for the dash-case option](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/3.x/bin/lessc).

### In production

Usually, it's recommended to extract the style sheets into a dedicated file in production using the [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin). This way your styles are not dependent on JavaScript:

```js
const ExtractTextPlugin = require("extract-text-webpack-plugin");

const extractLess = new ExtractTextPlugin({
    filename: "[name].[contenthash].css",
    disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
});

module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.less$/,
            use: extractLess.extract({
                use: [{
                    loader: "css-loader"
                }, {
                    loader: "less-loader"
                }],
                // use style-loader in development
                fallback: "style-loader"
            })
        }]
    },
    plugins: [
        extractLess
    ]
};
```

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

### Imports

Starting with less-loader 4, you can now choose between Less' builtin resolver and webpack's resolver. By default, webpack's resolver is used.

#### webpack resolver

webpack provides an [advanced mechanism to resolve files](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/). The less-loader applies a Less plugin that passes all queries to the webpack resolver. Thus you can import your Less modules from `node_modules`. Just prepend them with a `~` which tells webpack to look up the [`modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules).

```css
@import "~bootstrap/less/bootstrap";
```

It's important to only prepend it with `~`, because `~/` resolves to the home-directory. webpack needs to distinguish between `bootstrap` and `~bootstrap`, because CSS and Less files have no special syntax for importing relative files. Writing `@import "file"` is the same as `@import "./file";`

##### Non-Less imports

Using webpack's resolver, you can import any file type. You just need a loader that exports valid Less code. Often, you will also want to set the `issuer` condition to ensure that this rule is only applied on imports originating from Less files:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.js$/,
            issuer: /\.less$/,
            use: [{
                loader: "js-to-less-loader"
            }]
        }]
    }
};
```

#### Less resolver

If you specify the `paths` option, the less-loader will not use webpack's resolver. Modules, that can't be resolved in the local folder, will be searched in the given `paths`. This is Less' default behavior. `paths` should be an array with absolute paths:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.less$/,
            use: [{
                loader: "style-loader"
            }, {
                loader: "css-loader"
            }, {
                loader: "less-loader", options: {
                    paths: [
                        path.resolve(__dirname, "node_modules")
                    ]
                }
            }]
        }]
    }
};
```

In this case, all webpack features like importing non-Less files or aliasing won't work of course.

### Plugins

In order to use [plugins](http://lesscss.org/usage/#plugins), simply set the `plugins` option like this:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const CleanCSSPlugin = require("less-plugin-clean-css");

module.exports = {
    ...
            {
                loader: "less-loader", options: {
                    plugins: [
                        new CleanCSSPlugin({ advanced: true })
                    ]
                }
            }]
    ...
};
```

### Extracting style sheets

Bundling CSS with webpack has some nice advantages like referencing images and fonts with hashed urls or [hot module replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) in development. In production, on the other hand, it's not a good idea to apply your style sheets depending on JS execution. Rendering may be delayed or even a [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) might be visible. Thus it's often still better to have them as separate files in your final production build.

There are two possibilities to extract a style sheet from the bundle:

- [extract-loader](https://github.com/peerigon/extract-loader) (simpler, but specialized on the css-loader's output)
- [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) (more complex, but works in all use-cases)

### Source maps

To enable CSS source maps, you'll need to pass the `sourceMap` option to the less-loader *and* the css-loader. Your `webpack.config.js` should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.less$/,
            use: [{
                loader: "style-loader"
            }, {
                loader: "css-loader", options: {
                    sourceMap: true
                }
            }, {
                loader: "less-loader", options: {
                    sourceMap: true
                }
            }]
        }]
    }
};
```

Also checkout the [sourceMaps example](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/tree/master/examples/sourceMaps).

If you want to edit the original Less files inside Chrome, [there's a good blog post](https://medium.com/@toolmantim/getting-started-with-css-sourcemaps-and-in-browser-sass-editing-b4daab987fb0). The blog post is about Sass but it also works for Less.

### CSS modules gotcha

There is a known problem with Less and [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) regarding relative file paths in `url(...)` statements. [See this issue for an explanation](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/issues/109#issuecomment-253797335).

# less loader for webpack

## Installation

`npm install less-loader --save-dev`

## Usage

[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)

``` javascript
var css = require("!raw!less!./file.less");
// => returns compiled css code from file.less, resolves imports
var css = require("!css!less!./file.less");
// => returns compiled css code from file.less, resolves imports and url(...)s
```

Use in tandem with the [`style-loader`](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) to add the css rules to your document:

``` javascript
require("!style!css!less!./file.less");
```

### webpack config

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        loader: "style!css!less"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

Then you only need to write: `require("./file.less")`

### LESS options

You can pass any LESS specific configuration options through to the render function via [query parameters](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html#query-parameters).

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        loader: "style!css!less?strictMath&noIeCompat"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

See the [LESS documentation](http://lesscss.org/usage/#command-line-usage-options) for all available options. LESS translates dash-case to camelCase. Certain options which take values (e.g. `lessc --modify-var="a=b"`) are better handled with the [JSON loader syntax](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html#query-parameters) (`style!css!less?{"modifyVars":{"a":"b"}}`).  

### LESS plugins

In order to use [plugins](http://lesscss.org/usage/#plugins), simply set
the `lessLoader.lessPlugins`-option on your webpack options. You can also change the options' key with a query parameter: `"less?config=lessLoaderCustom"`.

``` javascript
var LessPluginCleanCSS = require('less-plugin-clean-css');

module.exports = {
  ...
  lessLoader: {
    lessPlugins: [
      new LessPluginCleanCSS({advanced: true})
    ]
  }
};
```

## Imports

webpack provides an [advanced mechanism to resolve files](http://webpack.github.io/docs/resolving.html). The less-loader stubs less' `fileLoader` and passes all queries to the webpack resolving engine. Thus you can import your less-modules from `node_modules`. Just prepend them with a `~` which tells webpack to look-up the [`modulesDirectories`](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-modulesdirectories)

```css
@import "~bootstrap/less/bootstrap";
```

It's important to only prepend it with `~`, because `~/` resolves to the home-directory. webpack needs to distinguish between `bootstrap` and `~bootstrap` because css- and less-files have no special syntax for importing relative files. Writing `@import "file"` is the same as `@import "./file";`

## Source maps

Because of browser limitations, source maps are only available in conjunction with the [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin). Use that plugin to extract the CSS code from the generated JS bundle into a separate file (which even improves the perceived performance because JS and CSS are loaded in parallel).

Then your `webpack.config.js` should look like this:

```javascript
var ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    ...
    // must be 'source-map' or 'inline-source-map'
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.less$/,
                loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
                    // activate source maps via loader query
                    'css?sourceMap!' +
                    'less?sourceMap'
                )
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        // extract inline css into separate 'styles.css'
        new ExtractTextPlugin('styles.css')
    ]
};
```

If you want to view the original LESS files inside Chrome and even edit it,  [there's a good blog post](https://medium.com/@toolmantim/getting-started-with-css-sourcemaps-and-in-browser-sass-editing-b4daab987fb0). Checkout [test/sourceMap](https://github.com/webpack/less-loader/tree/master/test) for a running example. Make sure to serve the content with an HTTP server.

## Contribution

Don't hesitate to create a pull request. Every contribution is appreciated. In development you can start the tests by calling `npm test`.

The tests are basically just comparing the generated css with a reference css-file located under `test/css`. You can easily generate a reference css-file by calling `node test/helpers/generateCss.js <less-file-without-less-extension>`. It passes the less-file to less and writes the output to the `test/css`-folder.
